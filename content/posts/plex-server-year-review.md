Here are some stats about my Plex server as a "year in review" type post. This only includes June through today, as that's the first month I started collecting this data. None of this data includes my own streaming (and two people in my plex "home"). A "play" is defined as a video file being watched at least 95% of the way through for movies, and 90% for TV shows, and it does include replays.

### A few totals
(again, not including myself)
- Movies: **753**
- TV Shows: **242**
    - Seasons: **852**
    - Episodes: **14171**
### Some fun facts!

Most popular movie: **Deadpool & Wolverine** 
Most popular TV show: **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia**
Most concurrent streams: **7**
